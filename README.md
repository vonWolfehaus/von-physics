# Physics

I fucking hate physics. That's why I had to write the tiniest library possible--so I didn't ever have to do this shit ever again!

These people fucking love physics, and they actually know what they're doing:
* My implementation is taken from [TutsPlus](http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/tutorials/implementation/create-custom-2d-physics-engine-aabb-circle-impulse-resolution)
* And for the circles, a combination of the above and [this guy's code](http://bluethen.com/wordpress/index.php/processing-app/do-you-like-balls/)
* So simple, so great: http://codepen.io/stuffit/pen/fhjvk (from [LonelyPixel](http://lonely-pixel.com/))

Other neat things that deal with vectors and or physics:
* Flocking done well: http://bluethen.com/wordpress/index.php/processing-app/flock-ai/
* Hot balls on quadratic curve action: http://lonely-pixel.com/lab/ballcurves/
* Algorithms for electromagnetics, thermal, quantum, etc: https://github.com/AbhiAgarwal/phys.js
