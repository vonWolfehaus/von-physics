# Physics

I fucking hate physics. That's why I had to write the tiniest library possible--so I didn't ever have to do this shit ever again!

These people fucking love physics, and they actually know what they're doing:
* My implementation is taken from [TutsPlus](http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/tutorials/implementation/create-custom-2d-physics-engine-aabb-circle-impulse-resolution)
* And for the circles, a combination of the above and [this guy's code](http://bluethen.com/wordpress/index.php/processing-app/do-you-like-balls/)
* So simple, so great: http://codepen.io/stuffit/pen/fhjvk (from [LonelyPixel](http://lonely-pixel.com/))

Other neat things that deal with vectors and or physics:
* Flocking done well: http://bluethen.com/wordpress/index.php/processing-app/flock-ai/
* Hot balls on quadratic curve action: http://lonely-pixel.com/lab/ballcurves/
* Algorithms for electromagnetics, thermal, quantum, etc: https://github.com/AbhiAgarwal/phys.js

## Full engines with readable code

* [PhysicsJS](https://github.com/wellcaffeinated/PhysicsJS)
* [p2](https://github.com/schteppe/p2.js)
* [newton](https://github.com/hunterloftis/newton)
* [Cannonjs](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js)
* [Coffee physics](https://github.com/soulwire/Coffee-Physics/blob/master/source/behaviour/Collision.coffee)
* [Impulse](https://github.com/dubrowgn/Impulse.js/blob/master/src/Shape2D.js)
* [microphysics](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/microphysics.js) (only mass and restitution, perfect for most games)

## Other tricks

* [Broadphase techniques](https://github.com/reu/broadphase.js)
* [Efficient ray casting](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/18436/most-efficient-aabb-vs-ray-collision-algorithms)
